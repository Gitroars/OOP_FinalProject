## Project Specifications <br>
The application is a digitalized version of Buku Kas, a physical book that records the income, expense and balance per each transaction made by a household or company. Its purpose is to monitor the flow of money within the household or company. This application was created to make it easier for everyone to be able to do so without going through the troublesome effort of writing formulas in Excel. The access a User has to the application depends on the level of authorization they have been granted.
